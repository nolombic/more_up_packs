# more_up_packs 
This mod lets you upgrade your upgrade packs, allowing you to have even higher stats.  
Affected stats are health and breath.  

## Higher stats, whaaaa?
[The original upgrade_packs mod by Krock](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Krock/upgrade_packs/ "Link to the upgrade_packs minetest ContentDB site") added four slots to the players inventory which they were able to fill with either +10 Health or +5 Breath each.  
Using only that mod a player could have up to +40HP or +20 Breath.  
I however thought that this wouldn't be enough for **some** reason.  

### So I've added more packs.
Introducing:  
#### ![green heart](https://creative.platerquack.net/development/more_up_packs/custom/green_heart.png) +20HP  
#### ![blue heart](https://creative.platerquack.net/development/more_up_packs/custom/blue_heart.png) +30HP  
#### ![violet heart](https://creative.platerquack.net/development/more_up_packs/custom/violet_heart.png) +40HP  
#### ![golden heart](https://creative.platerquack.net/development/more_up_packs/custom/golden_heart.png) +50HP  
as well as  
#### ![golden bubble](https://creative.platerquack.net/development/more_up_packs/custom/golden_bubble.png) +10 Breath

## That's all fine and dandy but how do you even craft them?
In order to craft one of these packs you take the previous level and surround it with the right items in order to upgrade the upgrade pack.

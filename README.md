# more_up_packs 
This mod lets you upgrade your upgrade packs, allowing you to have even higher stats.  
Affected stats are health and breath.  

## Higher stats, whaaaa?
[The original upgrade_packs mod by Krock](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Krock/upgrade_packs/ "Link to the upgrade_packs minetest ContentDB site") added four slots to the players inventory which they were able to fill with either +10 Health or +5 Breath each.  
Using only that mod a player could have up to +40HP or +20 Breath.  
I however thought that this wouldn't be enough for **some** reason.  

### So I've added more packs.
Introducing:  
#### ![green heart](https://creative.platerquack.net/development/more_up_packs/custom/green_heart.png) +20HP  
#### ![blue heart](https://creative.platerquack.net/development/more_up_packs/custom/blue_heart.png) +30HP  
#### ![violet heart](https://creative.platerquack.net/development/more_up_packs/custom/violet_heart.png) +40HP  
#### ![golden heart](https://creative.platerquack.net/development/more_up_packs/custom/golden_heart.png) +50HP  
as well as  
#### ![violet bubble](https://creative.platerquack.net/development/more_up_packs/custom/violet_bubble.png) +10 Breath  
#### ![pink bubble](https://creative.platerquack.net/development/more_up_packs/custom/pink_bubble.png) +15 Breath  
#### ![golden bubble](https://creative.platerquack.net/development/more_up_packs/custom/golden_bubble.png) +20 Breath

## That's all fine and dandy but how do you even craft them?
In order to craft one of these packs you take the previous level and surround it with the right items in order to upgrade the upgrade pack.

## Last but not least: Installation and dependencies

Installation of a mod must not be hard. Simply head into your minetest 5.0+ game and go to the ***Content*** tab. Tap on ***browse online content*** and wait for it to load up the available mod list. Using the search bar you have to make sure to install these mods:  
  
### [upgrade_packs](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Krock/upgrade_packs/)
the base that brings the core functionality. Must-have for this mod.  
### [mtg_plus](https://content.minetest.net/packages/Wuzzy/mtg_plus/)
optionally used for the +50HP upgrade pack to make it harder to craft.  
### [more_up_packs](https://content.minetest.net/packages/nolombic/more_up_packs/)
this mod.  

### Make sure the mods are enabled on your world! Otherwise they won't do anything but sit around unused.

Alternatively download the individual mods from their respective pages, extract their .zip files, maybe rename them, and move them to your mods folder.

## Thank you for showing interest in my silly little mod
Yours sincerely,
